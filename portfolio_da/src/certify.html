    <h1>CertificatesüèÜ</h1>
    <p>I've expanded my skill set through various experiences, including completing a Digital Marketing course from
        Google Garage. This learning journey equipped me with the knowledge to navigate the digital landscape
        effectively. Additionally, I've actively engaged in the tech community by organizing events for machine learning
        and participating in hackathons like DEVSOC'23, where my team secured a position in the top 6. This hands-on
        experience has sharpened my problem-solving skills and ability to work under pressure. Furthermore, I've
        completed a comprehensive web development course on Udemy, enhancing my proficiency in creating web-based
        solutions. These experiences collectively reflect my commitment to continuous learning and my passion for
        staying at the forefront of the ever-evolving tech industry.</p>

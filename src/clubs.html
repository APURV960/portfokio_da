    <h1>My Clubsüë®‚Äçüéì.</h1><br>
    <p>As a Senior Core Member at Mozilla Firefox Club VIT, I've been actively involved in a cool community where we
        work together on exciting tech projects. My job is to help out with important stuff and share my knowledge with
        the team. I've learned and used coding languages like Python and JavaScript to improve Mozilla Firefox, making
        it better for users. Besides coding, I've also helped new members learn and grow in the club. Being part of this
        club has not only let me help make Firefox awesome but has also taught me a lot about technology and teamwork.
